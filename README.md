# Web Component Development Project Year 4 Semester 1 

App created using react where you can log-in as a customer or administrator. Customer can log in and place and order whereas an administrator can place orders and edit items that are on the menu. 

## Description/Instructions

Instructions:
The screen images below give a suggested interface for a small restaurant. Once a staff member has 
logged into the system (fig.1 ) they may take orders. When logged as an administrator, food items 
can be added or removed from the restaurant menu. The restaurant selection menus (fig. 2) includes 
hot drinks, food and cold drinks(water/ cans). The selection of menu item requires going to a specific 
screen that shows all the possible hot drinks(fig. 3), food or cold drink options in that section. At 
each menu screen, the user may order one or more items from a particular menu and they may also 
order different item quantities. E.g they may order two coffees and one tea.  
On completion of the order the user selects ‘check out’ to get the order number and order details as 
shown in fig. 4.  
 
For the creation of this system, you are asked to use React to create the necessary UI components. 
The images shown represent a possible way to present the restaurant menu. As the developer you 
are free to change UI presentation.
